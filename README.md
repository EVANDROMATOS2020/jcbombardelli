# About me 😄
I may consider myself a software engineer (or a mage), but in reality I am just a guy who loves technology and how it can transform people's lives. I love projects with direct impact and with a high "mass transformational potential", that's why I hardly deny an opportunity for learning, not only with development, but also in other activities, such as design, product and digital business.

### ⚡ Fun fact: I have a tattoo with source code:
<div class="container">
  <div class="item-left">

  ```c
  #include <technology>
  #include <blockchain>

  bool main() {
    bool success;
    
    while(!success) {
      code();
      workHard();
      beNice();
      success = improve(this);
    }
    
    return success;
  }
  ```
  </div>

  <div class="item-right">
    <a href="https://app.daily.dev/jcbombardelli">

> before you try to fix my source code, understand it as poetry. OK!?
